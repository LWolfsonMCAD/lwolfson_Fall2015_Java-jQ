	<h1>SciGirls Seven</h1>

	<section class="intro">

	<!-- Introductory paragraph summarizing how the SciGirls Seven program and tips came about. -->
		<p class="sciseven-intro">In 2005, PBS created an outreach program called SciGirls to get and keep girls interested in STEM related projects, classes, and eventually careers. As part of their program they developed the “SciGirls Seven,” which combines 25 years of studies and research and boils the findings down into seven common strategies and approaches that work to engage girls in STEM pursuits.</p>

	<!-- SciGirls Seven tips/overview...can be expounded on in subsequent pages -->
	<section id="sciseven-list" class="main-content">

	<!-- Start of left-hand column, currently contains the first four SciGirls Seven tips -->
		<section id="sciseven-left-column">
			<article id="sciseven1" class="sciseven">	
				<p><span class="sciseven-tip">Girls benefit from collaboration, especially when they can participate and communicate fairly.</span><sup>1</sup> Girls are energized by the social part of science—working and learning together. Provide opportunities for small group work, and encourage girls to talk about their ideas and consider all possibilities before digging in. Make sure discussions remain respectful and inclusive, and that each girl’s contributions are valued. Girls are likely to remember not only what they learned, but also how they felt when they learned it. </p>

			<article id="sciseven2" class="sciseven">
				<p><span class="sciseven-tip">Girls are motivated by projects they find personally relevant and meaningful.</span><sup>2</sup> Girls become motivated when they feel their project or task is important and can make a difference. Support them using STEM as a tool to explore issues or topics they care about. If they see how STEM is relevant to their own lives and interests, their attraction to these subjects is likely to increase.</p>
			</article>
		
		
			<article id="sciseven3" class="sciseven">
				<p><span class="sciseven-tip">Girls enjoy hands-on, open-ended projects and investigations.</span><sup>3</sup> Promote exploration, imagination, and invention. Encourage your girls to ask questions and find their own paths for investigation.</p>
			</article>
		
			<article id="sciseven4" class="sciseven">
				<p><span class="sciseven-tip">Girls are motivated when they can approach projects in their own way, applying their creativity, unique talents, and preferred learning styles.</span><sup>4</sup> Encourage girls to develop their own ways of exploring and sharing knowledge, paying attention to the unique learning styles that motivate your group. You may be surprised by what creative, exciting approaches girls come up with when designing investigations, collecting data, and communicating results.</p>

	<!-- Start of right-hand column, currently contains the last three SciGirls Seven tips -->
		<section id="sciseven-right-column">
			<article id="sciseven5" class="sciseven">
				<p><span class="sciseven-tip">Girls’ confidence and performance improves in response to specific, positive feedback on things they can control—such as effort, strategies, and behaviors.</span><sup>5</sup> Self-confidence can make or break girls’ interest in STEM. Foster their efforts, compliment their strategies for problem solving, and let them know their skills can be improved through practice. Celebrate the struggle. Wrestling with problems and having experiments fail is a normal part of the scientific process! and inclusive, and that each girl’s contributions are valued. Girls are likely to remember not only what they learned, but also how they felt when they learned it. </p>
			</article>

			<article id="sciseven6" class="sciseven">
				<p><span class="sciseven-tip">Girls gain confidence and trust in their own reasoning when encouraged to think critically.</span><sup>6</sup> Cultivate an environment in which asking questions and creative thinking are a must. Throughout the centuries, this same trust in logic and re-examination of ideas made advances in science, technology, and engineering possible. </p>
			</article>

			<article id="sciseven7" class="sciseven">
				<p><span class="sciseven-tip">Girls benefit from relationships with role models and mentors.</span><sup>7</sup> Seeing women who have succeeded in STEM helps inspire and motivate girls, especially when they can relate to these role models as people with lives outside of the lab. Role models and mentors not only broaden girls’ views of who does science, but expand girls’ vision of what’s possible in their own lives.</p>
