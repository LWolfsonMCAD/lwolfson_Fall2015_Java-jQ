					<p>Kristi S. Anseth is a pioneer in biomedical engineering, a leading researcher and inventor in the fields of biomaterials and regenerative medicine. She has shown that by controlling the chemical, biological, and physical properties of biomaterials, fundamental cell biology questions can be probed and the information used in applications to regenerate tissue. Her work on engineering tissues has improved medical treatments for many parts of the body, from helping broken bones heal faster to replacing diseased heart valves. Anseth’s seminal work on the ways extracellular cues are transmitted through cells and her proof of novel mechanisms for biomolecule delivery have revolutionized the field. She is widely recognized for blending modern molecular and cellular biology with engineering and mathematics to produce the next generation of biomaterials that are tissue substitutes able to restore, maintain, or improve tissue function. Her discoveries have led to 17 patents—so far. In order to make those discoveries useful, Anseth founded Mosaic Biosciences, which translates these breakthroughs into useful applications for today’s medicine.</p>

					<p>Anseth, who grew up in North Dakota, received her bachelor’s degree from Purdue and then her PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Colorado. After postdoctoral work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Purdue, she was hired as an assistant professor in chemical engineering at the University of Colorado in 1996. In 2002 she was promoted to professor, was named Tisone Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering in 2003, and became a distinguished professor in 2008.</p>

					<p>Anseth was the first engineer to be named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. The American Institute of Chemical Engineers named her one of the “100 Chemical Engineers of the Modern Era,” and Popular Science named her one of its “Brilliant 10” in 2008. In 2009, she was elected to the National Academy of Engineering and to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. Anseth has been recognized by universities across the country and abroad, where she is frequently an invited speaker, and she is also a dedicated teacher who mentors and promotes the careers of her CU students. She  serves on 10 editorial boards and is highly sought for service on federal review panels such as the National Institutes of Health.</p>

			<h3 class="roleModelName">Ann Oaks - Professor and Plant Physiologist</h3>
			
			<div class="roleModelBio">
			
				<!-- <div class="roleModelPhotos">
				</div> -->

				<div class="roleModelInfo bioNoImages">
					<p class="disclaimer">The following was originally published on the American Society of Plant Biologists website.<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p>Ann Oaks was born and raised on the frontiers of Canada, and spent her career at the frontiers of plant research. Her early upbringing in austere, but caring conditions instilled in her a strong independent will, and a keen sense of survival, as well as a lasting interest in, and compassion for nature.</p>

					<p>Her higher education was at the University of Toronto in honors biology, where she developed an interest in plants, with the encouragement of Norm Good. She became excited by courses in physiology and biochemistry during her final years as an undergraduate, but maintained her interest in nature by working in the north during the summer months. After a year in Churchill, Manitoba, looking at cold hardiness in Chironomids, she studied the genetics and physiology of Chl-deficient mutants in barley for her master's degree at the University of Saskatchewan with Michael Shaw and Tom Arnason. Following a brief spell in Roy Waygood's lab and time at the College of Education in Toronto, she returned to Shaw's lab in Saskatoon to complete her Ph.D. on host--parasite relationships of wheat rust. There, her interest in plant biochemistry was solidified when she took a course from Arthur Neish. Then, in the late 1950s, as an Alexander von Humboldt scholar in Freising, she worked with Otto Kandler on the path of C in photosynthesis, before moving on to Harry Beever's lab in Purdue where she was initiated into the two interests that influenced the rest of her career: maize seedlings and nitrogen metabolism. She was appointed an assistant professor at McMaster University in 1965 and retired from there as a professor 24 years later. She then transferred her research to the University of Guelph as an adjunct professor for ten years.</p>

					<p>Ann's research career has been extensive and highly successful with many publications and seminal reviews; she has received the Gold Medal Award from the Canadian Society of Plant Physiologists, and has been inducted into the Royal Society of Canada. Major contributions have been made to our understanding of the hydrolysis of protein reserves in the endosperm of germinated maize, but arguably her more recognized research has been to elucidate the pivotal role of nitrate reductase (NR) in the nitrogen status of maize seedlings. The hydrolysis of maize endosperm reserves to support seedling growth was shown in her lab to require the activity of unique sets of proteases. These act in a two-step process; initially there is cleavage of the insoluble zeins by a specific endopeptidase and the soluble products of this are then sensitive to hydrolysis by less specialized endo- and exo-peptidases. The reduced N released from the maize endosperm then has a profound effect on ability of the seedling to take up and assimilate nitrate-N. Ann and her coworkers have established the importance of the balance between amide-N and carbohydrate supply in the induction of NR and on the N-economy of the growing seedling. This understanding of the complexities of nitrogen/nitrate metabolism at the physiological and biochemical level has provided an essential prelude to the modern molecular era in which gene activity and interactions are being elucidated. Ann developed and cherished working relationships with researchers from India, Japan, Europe and N. America. She, and her students and collaborators, laid some of the foundations upon which modern technologies are being successfully applied.</p>

					<p>Ann passed away, after a long and frustrating illness on Jan. 13th, 2006 at the age of 76. She recognized, espoused and imbued in her undergraduate and graduate students and colleagues the values of mentoring, of constantly challenging and questioning, and of personal discussions and contact. As a teacher, researcher, and innovator, she has made a difference.</p>

					<p class="disclaimer">The following biography was found on Ted.com<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p>Planetary scientist Carolyn Porco studies and interprets the photos from NASA space missions like the renowned Voyager mission to the outer solar system in the 1980s and the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn. She leads a team of scientists from the US and Europe that has been analyzing the images Cassini has sent back since it left Earth in 1997. At Saturn, they have found new phenomena everywhere they've turned their cameras … in the planet’s atmosphere, within its rings and on the surfaces of its many moons. And they've produced spectacular images and animations of these marvels in the process.</p>

					<p>Back in the early-1980s, while still working on her doctorate, Porco was drafted onto the Voyager imaging team to assist in crunching the mountains of data coming back from Voyager’s fly-by of Saturn. Her work on the planet's rings and their relation to its moons cemented her connection with Saturn. After Voyager had flown by Neptune and was nearing conclusion, she worked together with Carl Sagan in planning Voyager’s celebrated Pale Blue Dot picture of Earth.</p>

					<p>Her ongoing work at the Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations (CICLOPs) has two goals: to process, interpret and archive Cassini’s images for other scientists, and to make sure the images -- in all their breathtaking poetry and mystery and sheer Save-Image-As-Desktop awesomeness -- connect with the general public. She is an advocate for the exploration and understanding of planetary space, and her frequent talks (as well as her "Captain's Log" memos on the CICLOPS website) speak to everyone, scientist and nonscientist alike. Her advocacy extends to Hollywood, where she was the character consultant on the 1997 movie “Contact,” and a consultant on the 2009 Paramount Pictures re-boot of “Star Trek.” In 2012, she was named one the 25 most influential people in space by TIME magazine.</p>

					<p>Finally, in a twist on the Pale Blue Dot theme, it was she who conceived the idea to invite the people of the world to smile while Cassini imaged the Earth on July 19, 2013 in an event called “The Day the Earth Smiled.”</p>

			<h3 class="roleModelName">Nancy Grace Roman - Astronomer and NASA's first Chief of Astronomy</h3>
			
			<div class="roleModelBio">
			
				<!-- <div class="roleModelPhotos">
				</div> -->

				<div class="roleModelInfo bioNoImages">
					<p>Long before most women dared to consider a career in science, Nancy Grace Roman dreamed of being an astronomer. Born in 1925, she organized a backyard astronomy club for her friends when she was 11 and never stopped reaching for the stars. She went on to get her Ph.D. in astronomy at the University of Chicago in 1949 and became NASA’s first chief of astronomy — and the first woman to hold an executive position there. Roman’s greatest achievement is perhaps her pioneering crusade to develop orbiting telescopes, including the Hubble, which help astronomers detect stars’ electromagnetic radiation (such as infrared and gamma rays) that are mostly blocked by the Earth’s atmosphere. Her efforts have given countless astronomers a more complete vision of how stars form and evolve.<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p>The Roman Technology Fellowship in Astrophysics program is named after Dr. Nancy Grace Roman.  Dr. Roman is a distinguished American astronomer whose career has ranged from scientific research, to creating the first NASA astronomical program, to working with the teachers and students of today.</p>

					<p>Her honors are many, some of which include: NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Award, NASA Outstanding Scientific Leadership Award, the American Astronautical Society's William Randolf Lovelace II Award, American Astronomical Society Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow, and the Women in Aerospace's Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>

					<p>Dr Roman is a true inspiration to the students of today. Raised in a time when women were discouraged from pursuing a science career, she not only succeeded in establishing herself in a scientific career, but she has left a legacy for the astronomers of today and tomorrow. Often called the "Mother of Hubble", due to her efforts in making the Hubble Space Telescope a reality, Dr. Roman was instrumental in establishing the new era of space-based astronomical instrumentation.<sup>2</sup></p>

					<p>Dorothy “Dottie” Metcalf-Lindenburger, the daughter of two teachers with a love of the space program, has “The Right Stuff.” As a NASA astronaut who flew with the crew of STS-131 to the International Space Station, Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger has risen to heights that make those of the Mile High City of Denver, in which she grew up, pale by comparison. </p>

					<p>It may have been inevitable that Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger would follow in her parents’ footsteps to become a high school earth science and astron-
					omy teacher – and inevitable, too, that she would copy them by sharing her love of the space program with her students. As Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger writes, while she found photos from the Hubble Space Telescope “fascinating,” it was her fascination that bred a similar fascination about spaceflight in her students. </p>

					<p>And, it was one of her students who, in raising the question “How do astronauts go to the bathroom in space?”, led Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger to a NASA Website that not only provided
					her the answer but also an application to become an educator astronaut. As an earth science and astronomy teacher, Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger seemed a natural fit for the astronaut program – she had earned her bachelor’s degree in geology from Whitman College, Walla Walla, Washington, and her teaching certificate from Central Washington University, Ellensburg – but it was her enthusiasm and eagerness for spaceflight, that “Right Stuff” nurtured in her by two teachers, her parents, that made her stand out among all other candidates to win her a much-coveted place in the astronaut program.<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p class="disclaimer">From Maximum PC's article "The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p>Born Frances Elizabeth Snyder, Betty Holberton attended the University of Pennysylvania, where on her first day of classes, she was reportedly told by her math professor to quit wasting her time attempting a mathematics degree and to stay home and raise children. Holberton instead studied journalism, then went on to be hired by the Moore School of Eningeering to be one of the first “computors” to work on ENIAC. Apparently her professor was wrong, as she became the Chief of the Programming Research Branch, Applied Mathematics Laboratory at the David Taylor Model Basin in 1959, helped to develop UNIVAC, wrote the first generative programming system (SORT/MERGE), and the first statistical analysis package for the 1950 U.S. Census. Holberton worked with John Mauchly to develop the C-10 insturctions for BINAC (generally considered to be the origins of modern programming languages), and also worked with Grace Hopper in the early standards of COBOL and FORTRAN. Not only did Holberton create commands, but she was also responsible for developing the numeric keypad and for making computers that awful beige color. Holberton was the only woman, of the original six ENIAC programmers, to receive the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award in 1997.</p>
