					<p class="disclaimer">The following was originally published on the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame website.<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p>Kristi S. Anseth is a pioneer in biomedical engineering, a leading researcher and inventor in the fields of biomaterials and regenerative medicine. She has shown that by controlling the chemical, biological, and physical properties of biomaterials, fundamental cell biology questions can be probed and the information used in applications to regenerate tissue. Her work on engineering tissues has improved medical treatments for many parts of the body, from helping broken bones heal faster to replacing diseased heart valves. Anseth’s seminal work on the ways extracellular cues are transmitted through cells and her proof of novel mechanisms for biomolecule delivery have revolutionized the field. She is widely recognized for blending modern molecular and cellular biology with engineering and mathematics to produce the next generation of biomaterials that are tissue substitutes able to restore, maintain, or improve tissue function. Her discoveries have led to 17 patents—so far. In order to make those discoveries useful, Anseth founded Mosaic Biosciences, which translates these breakthroughs into useful applications for today’s medicine.</p>

					<p>Anseth, who grew up in North Dakota, received her bachelor’s degree from Purdue and then her PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Colorado. After postdoctoral work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Purdue, she was hired as an assistant professor in chemical engineering at the University of Colorado in 1996. In 2002 she was promoted to professor, was named Tisone Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering in 2003, and became a distinguished professor in 2008.</p>

					<p>Anseth was the first engineer to be named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. The American Institute of Chemical Engineers named her one of the “100 Chemical Engineers of the Modern Era,” and Popular Science named her one of its “Brilliant 10” in 2008. In 2009, she was elected to the National Academy of Engineering and to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. Anseth has been recognized by universities across the country and abroad, where she is frequently an invited speaker, and she is also a dedicated teacher who mentors and promotes the careers of her CU students. She  serves on 10 editorial boards and is highly sought for service on federal review panels such as the National Institutes of Health.</p>

			<h3 class="roleModelName">Ann Oaks - Professor and Plant Physiologist</h3>
			
			<div class="roleModelBio">
			
				<!-- <div class="roleModelPhotos">
				</div> -->

				<div class="roleModelInfo bioNoImages">
					<p class="disclaimer">The following was originally published on the American Society of Plant Biologists website.<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p>Ann Oaks was born and raised on the frontiers of Canada, and spent her career at the frontiers of plant research. Her early upbringing in austere, but caring conditions instilled in her a strong independent will, and a keen sense of survival, as well as a lasting interest in, and compassion for nature.</p>

					<p>Her higher education was at the University of Toronto in honors biology, where she developed an interest in plants, with the encouragement of Norm Good. She became excited by courses in physiology and biochemistry during her final years as an undergraduate, but maintained her interest in nature by working in the north during the summer months. After a year in Churchill, Manitoba, looking at cold hardiness in Chironomids, she studied the genetics and physiology of Chl-deficient mutants in barley for her master's degree at the University of Saskatchewan with Michael Shaw and Tom Arnason. Following a brief spell in Roy Waygood's lab and time at the College of Education in Toronto, she returned to Shaw's lab in Saskatoon to complete her Ph.D. on host--parasite relationships of wheat rust. There, her interest in plant biochemistry was solidified when she took a course from Arthur Neish. Then, in the late 1950s, as an Alexander von Humboldt scholar in Freising, she worked with Otto Kandler on the path of C in photosynthesis, before moving on to Harry Beever's lab in Purdue where she was initiated into the two interests that influenced the rest of her career: maize seedlings and nitrogen metabolism. She was appointed an assistant professor at McMaster University in 1965 and retired from there as a professor 24 years later. She then transferred her research to the University of Guelph as an adjunct professor for ten years.</p>

					<p>Ann's research career has been extensive and highly successful with many publications and seminal reviews; she has received the Gold Medal Award from the Canadian Society of Plant Physiologists, and has been inducted into the Royal Society of Canada. Major contributions have been made to our understanding of the hydrolysis of protein reserves in the endosperm of germinated maize, but arguably her more recognized research has been to elucidate the pivotal role of nitrate reductase (NR) in the nitrogen status of maize seedlings. The hydrolysis of maize endosperm reserves to support seedling growth was shown in her lab to require the activity of unique sets of proteases. These act in a two-step process; initially there is cleavage of the insoluble zeins by a specific endopeptidase and the soluble products of this are then sensitive to hydrolysis by less specialized endo- and exo-peptidases. The reduced N released from the maize endosperm then has a profound effect on ability of the seedling to take up and assimilate nitrate-N. Ann and her coworkers have established the importance of the balance between amide-N and carbohydrate supply in the induction of NR and on the N-economy of the growing seedling. This understanding of the complexities of nitrogen/nitrate metabolism at the physiological and biochemical level has provided an essential prelude to the modern molecular era in which gene activity and interactions are being elucidated. Ann developed and cherished working relationships with researchers from India, Japan, Europe and N. America. She, and her students and collaborators, laid some of the foundations upon which modern technologies are being successfully applied.</p>

					<p>Ann passed away, after a long and frustrating illness on Jan. 13th, 2006 at the age of 76. She recognized, espoused and imbued in her undergraduate and graduate students and colleagues the values of mentoring, of constantly challenging and questioning, and of personal discussions and contact. As a teacher, researcher, and innovator, she has made a difference.</p>

					<p class="disclaimer">Biography found on FamousScientists.org website.<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p>Stephanie Kwolek was an organic chemist, best known for inventing Kevlar in 1965. Kevlar is an immensely strong plastic, which was first used as a replacement for steel reinforcing strips in racing car tires and has gone on to be used in a large number of applications where high strength is required without high weight.

					<p>Stephanie Louise Kwolek was born in 1923 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. Her father died when she was only 10 years old, but he passed on his interest in science, particularly natural science to his daughter.

					<p>Aged 23, Kwolek graduated with a degree in chemistry from Margaret Morrison Carnegie College of Carnegie Mellon University. She was quickly recruited to work as a chemist at Dupont Chemicals in Buffalo, NY. Four years later, she moved to Wilmington, Delaware where she spent the remainder of her career with DuPont.

					<p>After nine years of research work, Kwolek made her major breakthrough, discovering Kevlar. Her pathway to discovery began a year earlier, when she began looking for a new, lightweight plastic to be used in car tires. The idea was that lighter tires would allow vehicles to enjoy better fuel economy.

					<p>Not only did Kevlar find use in tires, its combination of lightness and strength has seen it used in a large variety of protective clothing applications, such as bulletproof vests, which have saved the lives of countless police officers and other people.

					<p>Speaking about her discovery, Stephanie Kwolek, “I don’t think there’s anything like saving someone’s life to bring you satisfaction and happiness.”

					<p>Stephanie Kwolek died on June 18, 2014, at the age of 90.

					<p>Stephanie Louise Kwolek was awarded the National Medal of Technology; the Perkin Medal, which is seen as the highest award in American industrial chemistry; the Chemical Pioneer Award of the American Institute of Chemists; and the Howard N. Potts Medal for Engineering. In 1994, she was admitted to the National Inventors Hall of Fame.</p>

					<p class="disclaimer">The following biography was found on Ted.com<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p>Planetary scientist Carolyn Porco studies and interprets the photos from NASA space missions like the renowned Voyager mission to the outer solar system in the 1980s and the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn. She leads a team of scientists from the US and Europe that has been analyzing the images Cassini has sent back since it left Earth in 1997. At Saturn, they have found new phenomena everywhere they've turned their cameras … in the planet’s atmosphere, within its rings and on the surfaces of its many moons. And they've produced spectacular images and animations of these marvels in the process.</p>

					<p>Back in the early-1980s, while still working on her doctorate, Porco was drafted onto the Voyager imaging team to assist in crunching the mountains of data coming back from Voyager’s fly-by of Saturn. Her work on the planet's rings and their relation to its moons cemented her connection with Saturn. After Voyager had flown by Neptune and was nearing conclusion, she worked together with Carl Sagan in planning Voyager’s celebrated Pale Blue Dot picture of Earth.</p>

					<p>Her ongoing work at the Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations (CICLOPs) has two goals: to process, interpret and archive Cassini’s images for other scientists, and to make sure the images -- in all their breathtaking poetry and mystery and sheer Save-Image-As-Desktop awesomeness -- connect with the general public. She is an advocate for the exploration and understanding of planetary space, and her frequent talks (as well as her "Captain's Log" memos on the CICLOPS website) speak to everyone, scientist and nonscientist alike. Her advocacy extends to Hollywood, where she was the character consultant on the 1997 movie “Contact,” and a consultant on the 2009 Paramount Pictures re-boot of “Star Trek.” In 2012, she was named one the 25 most influential people in space by TIME magazine.</p>

					<p>Finally, in a twist on the Pale Blue Dot theme, it was she who conceived the idea to invite the people of the world to smile while Cassini imaged the Earth on July 19, 2013 in an event called “The Day the Earth Smiled.”</p>

			<h3 class="roleModelName">Nancy Grace Roman - Astronomer and NASA's first Chief of Astronomy</h3>
			
			<div class="roleModelBio">
			
				<!-- <div class="roleModelPhotos">
				</div> -->

				<div class="roleModelInfo bioNoImages">
					<p>Long before most women dared to consider a career in science, Nancy Grace Roman dreamed of being an astronomer. Born in 1925, she organized a backyard astronomy club for her friends when she was 11 and never stopped reaching for the stars. She went on to get her Ph.D. in astronomy at the University of Chicago in 1949 and became NASA’s first chief of astronomy — and the first woman to hold an executive position there. Roman’s greatest achievement is perhaps her pioneering crusade to develop orbiting telescopes, including the Hubble, which help astronomers detect stars’ electromagnetic radiation (such as infrared and gamma rays) that are mostly blocked by the Earth’s atmosphere. Her efforts have given countless astronomers a more complete vision of how stars form and evolve.<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p>The Roman Technology Fellowship in Astrophysics program is named after Dr. Nancy Grace Roman.  Dr. Roman is a distinguished American astronomer whose career has ranged from scientific research, to creating the first NASA astronomical program, to working with the teachers and students of today.</p>

					<p>Her honors are many, some of which include: NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Award, NASA Outstanding Scientific Leadership Award, the American Astronautical Society's William Randolf Lovelace II Award, American Astronomical Society Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow, and the Women in Aerospace's Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>

					<p>Dr Roman is a true inspiration to the students of today. Raised in a time when women were discouraged from pursuing a science career, she not only succeeded in establishing herself in a scientific career, but she has left a legacy for the astronomers of today and tomorrow. Often called the "Mother of Hubble", due to her efforts in making the Hubble Space Telescope a reality, Dr. Roman was instrumental in establishing the new era of space-based astronomical instrumentation.<sup>2</sup></p>

She developed curriculum and taught volunteer personal health training, wrote manuals for self-care, developed and implemented guidelines for public health/safety issues for volunteer job placement and training sites. Dr. Jemison developed and participated in research projects on Hepatitis B vaccine, schistosomaisis and rabies in conjunction with the National Institute of Health and the Center for Disease Control.</p>

					<p>On return to the United States, Dr. Jemison joined CIGNA Health Plans of California in October 1985 and was working as a General Practitioner and attending graduate engineering classes in Los Angeles when selected to the [NASA] astronaut program.</p>

					<p>NASA EXPERIENCE: Dr. Jemison was selected for the astronaut program in June 1987. Her technical assignments since then have included: launch support activities at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida; verification of Shuttle computer software in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); Science Support Group activities.</p>

					<p>Dr. Jemison was the science mission specialist on STS-47 Spacelab-J (September 12-20, 1992). STS-47 was a cooperative mission between the United States and Japan. The eight-day mission was accomplished in 127 orbits of the Earth, and included 44 Japanese and U.S. life science and materials processing experiments. Dr. Jemison was a co-investigator on the bone cell research experiment flown on the mission. The Endeavour and her crew launched from and returned to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. In completing her first space flight, Dr. Jemison logged 190 hours, 30 minutes, 23 seconds in space.<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p>Dorothy “Dottie” Metcalf-Lindenburger, the daughter of two teachers with a love of the space program, has “The Right Stuff.” As a NASA astronaut who flew with the crew of STS-131 to the International Space Station, Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger has risen to heights that make those of the Mile High City of Denver, in which she grew up, pale by comparison. </p>

					<p>It may have been inevitable that Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger would follow in her parents’ footsteps to become a high school earth science and astron-
					omy teacher – and inevitable, too, that she would copy them by sharing her love of the space program with her students. As Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger writes, while she found photos from the Hubble Space Telescope “fascinating,” it was her fascination that bred a similar fascination about spaceflight in her students. </p>

					<p>And, it was one of her students who, in raising the question “How do astronauts go to the bathroom in space?”, led Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger to a NASA Website that not only provided
					her the answer but also an application to become an educator astronaut. As an earth science and astronomy teacher, Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger seemed a natural fit for the astronaut program – she had earned her bachelor’s degree in geology from Whitman College, Walla Walla, Washington, and her teaching certificate from Central Washington University, Ellensburg – but it was her enthusiasm and eagerness for spaceflight, that “Right Stuff” nurtured in her by two teachers, her parents, that made her stand out among all other candidates to win her a much-coveted place in the astronaut program.<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p>Born Frances Elizabeth Snyder, Betty Holberton attended the University of Pennysylvania, where on her first day of classes, she was reportedly told by her math professor to quit wasting her time attempting a mathematics degree and to stay home and raise children. Holberton instead studied journalism, then went on to be hired by the Moore School of Eningeering to be one of the first “computors” to work on ENIAC. Apparently her professor was wrong, as she became the Chief of the Programming Research Branch, Applied Mathematics Laboratory at the David Taylor Model Basin in 1959, helped to develop UNIVAC, wrote the first generative programming system (SORT/MERGE), and the first statistical analysis package for the 1950 U.S. Census. Holberton worked with John Mauchly to develop the C-10 insturctions for BINAC (generally considered to be the origins of modern programming languages), and also worked with Grace Hopper in the early standards of COBOL and FORTRAN. Not only did Holberton create commands, but she was also responsible for developing the numeric keypad and for making computers that awful beige color. Holberton was the only woman, of the original six ENIAC programmers, to receive the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award in 1997.</p>

Layar initially was a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android app, but the company also has an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS version. Boonstra has said that Layar will develop to other platforms, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and even Symbian.</p>

					<p>Layar's app has been downloaded to 25 million phones in 209 countries. Layar has more than 50 partners and most recently joined forces with Dwell magazine and AHALife.com to create a digital shopping app that lets readers scan an item with their smartphone and then links them directly to the AHAlife.com site where they can purchase the item. The app is also being used by educational firms to help bring augmented reality to schools.</p>

					<p>In 2010 Boonstra was named one of the top female founders to watch by Women 2.0, and she also was named one of the most influential women in technology. Boonstra often speaks at industry events about her company and the role of women in tech. She also was a featured speaker at the TEDxAmsterdamED conference where to she talked about how she wants to change the way we define success--and how the education system needs to be value-based instead of status-based.</p>

					<p>The most famous female name in rocket science, she was the first woman to enter the field and be recognized as a rocket scientist. She created the rocket fuel Hydyne that, in 1957, saved the United States from disastrous earlier attempts to send satellites into space. The rocket carrying our first successful satellite, Explorer 1, into space used her fuel. So despite the Russians getting the Sputnik into orbit first, thanks to Mary, we quickly recovered and became dominant in the space race.</p>

					<p>Mary Sherman Morgan was born in 1921 as the second-to-last of six children to a family in Ray, North Dakota. Despite early setbacks to school attendance – her father was reluctant to allow her to go – she showed an excellence in academics that helped her not only make up two years lost, but then go ahead of her peers and graduate as valedictorian in high school. To get into college, she ran away from home after graduation and signed up at Minot State University as a chemistry major.</p>

					<p>When World War II broke out, Mary was a mother had to leave college to care for her family. She was recruited by a local factory to begin work on top secret explosives formulas for the military during the war, keeping her chemistry background moving forward. She was the only woman at the factory. She was at North American Aviation still, in 1957, when the government looked again to launch a rocket after Wernher von Braun’s designs proved to be insufficient to the task. Mary Sherman was placed in charge of the contract at NAA and the rest is history. Mrs. Morgan died in 2004.</p>

				<p>She was born Nora Stanton Blatch in Basingstoke, Hampshire, England in 1883 to William Blatch and Harriot Eaton Stanton, daughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. She studied Latin and mathematics at the Horace Mann School in New York, beginning in 1897, returning to England in the summers. The family moved to the United States in 1902. Nora attended Cornell University, graduating in 1905 as the first woman to earn a degree in any type of engineering in the United States; her degree was in civil engineering. In the same year, she was accepted as a junior member of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), and began work for the New York City Board of Water Supply.[1][2] Following the examples set by her mother and grandmother, Nora also became active in the growing women's suffrage movement. She was the first female member of the American Society of Civil Engineers where she was allowed to be a junior member only and denied advancement to associate member in 1916 solely because of her gender. To right this wrong, ASCE elected her Fellow in 2015.</p>

				<p>...In 1909, Nora began working as an engineer for the Radley Steel Construction Company. [Following that] she continued her engineering career, working for the New York Public Service Commission as an assistant engineer, and later for the Public Works Administration in Connecticut and Rhode Island as an architect, engineering inspector and structural-steel designer.</p>

			<div class="roleModelInfo longBio">
				<p class="disclaimer">Biography from the Edison Tech Center website.<sup>1</sup></p>

				<p>Edith Clarke 1883 - 1959 , born in a small farming community in Maryland in 1883, went to Vassar College to study mathematics and astronomy and graduated in 1908 with Phi Beta Kappa honors. Subsequently, she taught mathematics at a private girls' school in San Francisco, and then at Marshall College in Huntington, WV. In the fall of 1911, Edith enrolled as a civil engineering student at the University of Wisconsin. At the end of her first year, she took a summer job as a "Computer Assistant" to AT&amp;T research engineer Dr. George Campbell and was so interested in her work that she stayed on at AT&amp;T to train and direct a group of (human) "computers."</p>

				<p>In 1918, Edith left to enroll in the EE program at MIT, earning her MSc. degree, the first such degree ever awarded by that department to a woman, in June 1919. She then took a job as a "computer" for General Electric in Schenectady, NY, and in 1921 filed a patent for a "graphical calculator" to be employed in solving electric power transmission line problems.</p>

				<p>In 1921, Edith took leave from GE to take a position as a professor of physics at the Constantinople Women's College in Turkey and returned to GE in 1922 as a salaried electrical engineer. In 1926, Edith Clarke was the first woman to present a paper before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. This paper was of critical national importance. At the time, transmission lines were getting longer, and with longer lines came greater loads and more chances for system instability. Unfortunately, the mathematical models available at the time applied only to small systems. Edith applied a mathematical technique called the method of symmetrical components to model a power system and its behavior. This permitted her and other engineers to determine characteristics essential to analyzing large systems.</p>

				<p>Clarke wrote and published a great deal. She wrote many, many useful papers pertaining to power distribution and synchronous machines and a comprehensive EE textbook for engineering schools and colleges. She also received two patents related to electrical power transmission.</p>

				<p>In 1947 Clarke left GE after 26 years to teach electrical engineering at the University of Texas, Austin, where she became the first female EE professor in the US and worked there until retirement in 1956. She became the first woman to be elected a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (which became the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE). In 1954, she received a lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of Women Engineers. The Award cited her contributions to the field in the form of her simplifying charts and her work in system instability. Edith Clarke died five years later, on October 29, 1959 in Olney, Maryland.</p>

				<p>Dr. James E. Brittain's paper, "From Computer to Electrical Engineer - the Remarkable Career of Edith Clarke," explains why Edith was a pioneer for women in both engineering and computing:</p>

				<p>"Edith Clarke's engineering career had as its central theme the development and dissemination of mathematical methods that tended to simplify and reduce the time spent in laborious calculations in solving problems in the design and operation of electrical power systems. She translated what many engineers found to be esoteric mathematical methods into graphs or simpler forms during a time when power systems were becoming more complex and when the initial efforts were being made to develop electromechanical aids to problem solving. As a woman who worked in an environment traditionally dominated by men, she demonstrated effectively that women could perform at least as well as men if given the opportunity. Her outstanding achievements provided an inspiring example for the next generation of women with aspirations to become career engineers."</p>

				<p>When QuynhGiao and her parents immigrated from Vietnam, she didn’t speak a word of English. From age seven on, though, she made it her priority to master the language and excel. After twelve years, at the age of 19, she was accepted as an intern at NASA’s Environmental Durability Branch. That gave her a foot in the door towards a full time job at NASA after graduation from CSU. Since then, she has not looked back.</p>

					<p>Think of 1940s actress Hedy Lamarr and the term “bombshell” might come to mind, but perhaps not in the way she would have wished.</p> 

					<p>Voted the most desirable, beautiful actress or pinup during World War II, few people know that Lamar had a workbench in her Hollywood home where she tinkered on a regular basis.</p>

					<p>The beauty with brains had experimented with automated control of musical instruments. Together with George Antheil, she submitted the idea of a secret communication system in June 1941 and in 1942 received US Patent 2,292,387.</p> 

					<p>In essence, the patent covered an early version of frequency hopping used a piano roll to change between 88 frequencies and was intended to make radio-guided torpedoes harder for enemies to detect or jam.</p> 

					<p>The Navy passed on the idea in the 1940s but it was eventually implemented in the US in 1962 after the patent had expired, when it was used by military ships during a blockade of Cuba.</p>

					<p>The patent was little-known until 1997, when the Electronic Frontier Foundation gave Lamarr an award for her contribution -- A worthy one at that, as Lamarr and Antheil's frequency-hopping idea served as a basis for modern spread-spectrum communication technology, such as Bluetooth, COFDM used in Wi-Fi network connections, and CDMA used in some cordless and wireless telephones.</p>

					<p>It has been reported that Lamarr wanted to become better known for her inventiveness but was often brushed off by scientific communities because of her acting career or outright refused in certain circles because she was a woman.</p>

					<p>Lamarr died in January 2000 at the age of 86.</p>

					<p>Elizabeth Leonard Scott (November 23, 1917 – December 20, 1988) was an American mathematician specializing in statistics.</p>

					<p>Scott was born in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Her family moved to Berkeley, California when she was 4 years old. She attended the University of California, Berkeley where she studied mathematics and astronomy. There were few options for further study in astronomy, as the field was largely closed to women at the time, so she completed her graduate studies in mathematics. She received her Ph.D. in 1949, and received a permanent position in the Department of Mathematics at Berkeley in 1951.</p>

					<p>She wrote over 30 papers on astronomy and 30 on weather modification research analysis, incorporating and expanding the use of statistical analyses in these fields. She also used statistics to promote equal opportunities and equal pay for female academics.</p>

					<p>In 1957 Elizabeth Scott noted a bias in the observation of galaxy clusters. She noticed that for an observer to find a very distant cluster, it must contain brighter than normal galaxies and must also contain a large number of galaxies. She proposed a correction formula to adjust for (what came to be known as) the Scott effect.</p>

					<p>The Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies awards a prize in her honour to female statisticians.</p>

					<p>When Ruth Gonzalez received her Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1986 from Rice University, she became the first U.S.-born Hispanic woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics. Her thesis in computational mathematics, written under the supervision of Mary Wheeler, was entitled "Domain Decomposition for Two-Dimensional Elliptic Operators on Vector and Parallel Machines".</p>

					<p>Gonzalez, both of whose parents came from Mexico, was raised in Houston, Texas. Her interest in math and science developed throughout her elementary and high school education. Gonzalez completed her bachelor's degree in mathematics at the University of Texas in 1976, then did research at the Applied Research Laboratories at the University of Texas from 1976 to 1980. Her work involved developing mathematical models for wave propagation problems in underwater acoustics. These could be used, for example, to position submarines to avoid detection. Meanwhile she also earned her master's degree in mathematics at Texas.</p>

					<p>In 1980 Gonzalez joined the Exxon Production Research Company. She completed her graduate work at Rice while working full-time as a geophysical mathematician at Exxon (now ExxonMobil). Her work at Exxon focused on the development of seismic imaging tools for exploring oil and gas reservoirs. In the 1990's she headed a team of researchers who developed technology to turn seismic data into three-dimensional views of rock formations deep inside the earth, thus helping other specialists to decide where to drill for oil and gas. She has also served as an advisor in the Geophysical Processing Department at ExxonMobil and is currently an advisor for the Project Facilitation Team of the ExxonMobil Exploration Company.</p>

					<p>Gonzalez enjoys encouraging other minority women and girls to explore careers in math and science. She said in an interview in a 1998 Exxon publication that "if they can just see how much science affects them every day, these kids begin to understand its relevance in their lives and learn that math can be fun, not just some horrible subject the have to suffer through." Gonzalez has also served as a adult-literacy tutor at a program she supports at Rice University.</p>

					<p>Goldwasser's research areas include computational complexity theory, cryptography and computational number theory. She is the co-inventor of zero-knowledge proofs, which probabilistically and interactively demonstrate the validity of an assertion without conveying any additional knowledge, and are a key tool in the design of cryptographic protocols. Her work in complexity theory includes the classification of approximation problems, showing that some problems in NP remain hard even when only an approximate solution is needed.</p>
