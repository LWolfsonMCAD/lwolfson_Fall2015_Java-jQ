					<p class="disclaimer">The following was originally published on the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame website.<sup>1</sup></p>

					<p>Kristi S. Anseth is a pioneer in biomedical engineering, a leading researcher and inventor in the fields of biomaterials and regenerative medicine. She has shown that by controlling the chemical, biological, and physical properties of biomaterials, fundamental cell biology questions can be probed and the information used in applications to regenerate tissue. Her work on engineering tissues has improved medical treatments for many parts of the body, from helping broken bones heal faster to replacing diseased heart valves. Anseth’s seminal work on the ways extracellular cues are transmitted through cells and her proof of novel mechanisms for biomolecule delivery have revolutionized the field. She is widely recognized for blending modern molecular and cellular biology with engineering and mathematics to produce the next generation of biomaterials that are tissue substitutes able to restore, maintain, or improve tissue function. Her discoveries have led to 17 patents—so far. In order to make those discoveries useful, Anseth founded Mosaic Biosciences, which translates these breakthroughs into useful applications for today’s medicine.</p>

					<p>Anseth, who grew up in North Dakota, received her bachelor’s degree from Purdue and then her PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Colorado. After postdoctoral work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Purdue, she was hired as an assistant professor in chemical engineering at the University of Colorado in 1996. In 2002 she was promoted to professor, was named Tisone Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering in 2003, and became a distinguished professor in 2008.</p>

					<p>Anseth was the first engineer to be named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. The American Institute of Chemical Engineers named her one of the “100 Chemical Engineers of the Modern Era,” and Popular Science named her one of its “Brilliant 10” in 2008. In 2009, she was elected to the National Academy of Engineering and to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. Anseth has been recognized by universities across the country and abroad, where she is frequently an invited speaker, and she is also a dedicated teacher who mentors and promotes the careers of her CU students. She  serves on 10 editorial boards and is highly sought for service on federal review panels such as the National Institutes of Health.</p>

In 2002, Persis accepted a position as Professor and Director of Research at SLAC. In 2007 she was named Director at SLAC.  Her current research activities are in particle astrophysics and Free Electron Laser science.</p>

					<p>Persis has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship; a National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award; she is a fellow of the American Physical Society; a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. In spring of 2006 she was the Morris Loeb Lecturer in Physics at Harvard University, and in winter of 2011 Persis was the Occam Lecturer at Merton College, Oxford. In 2012 she was the recipient of the 2012 Helmholtz International Fellow Award for outstanding scientific achievement.</p>

					<p class="disclaimer">When asked "What excites you about your work at the Energy Department?" Drell answered:</p>

					<p>I can work on big problems and big science.  In a National Lab, one has the resources to make a really big impact on science.  I’ve enjoyed participating in major efforts that have the ability to change our view of the world we live in, like the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope and the Linac Coherent Light Source.</p>

				<div class="roleModelInfo">
					<p>Dorothy “Dottie” Metcalf-Lindenburger, the daughter of two teachers with a love of the space program, has “The Right Stuff.” As a NASA astronaut who flew with the crew of STS-131 to the International Space Station, Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger has risen to heights that make those of the Mile High City of Denver, in which she grew up, pale by comparison. </p>

					<p>It may have been inevitable that Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger would follow in her parents’ footsteps to become a high school earth science and astron-
					omy teacher – and inevitable, too, that she would copy them by sharing her love of the space program with her students. As Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger writes, while she found photos from the Hubble Space Telescope “fascinating,” it was her fascination that bred a similar fascination about spaceflight in her students. </p>

					<p>And, it was one of her students who, in raising the question “How do astronauts go to the bathroom in space?”, led Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger to a NASA Website that not only provided
					her the answer but also an application to become an educator astronaut. As an earth science and astronomy teacher, Ms. Metcalf-Lindenburger seemed a natural fit for the astronaut program – she had earned her bachelor’s degree in geology from Whitman College, Walla Walla, Washington, and her teaching certificate from Central Washington University, Ellensburg – but it was her enthusiasm and eagerness for spaceflight, that “Right Stuff” nurtured in her by two teachers, her parents, that made her stand out among all other candidates to win her a much-coveted place in the astronaut program.<sup>1</sup></p>
