  	    <p>HAMLET: To be, or not to be--that is the question: 
        Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
        Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
        And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep--
        No more--and by a sleep to say we end
        The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
        That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
        Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--
        To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,
        For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
        When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
        Must give us pause. There's the respect
        That makes calamity of so long life.
        For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
        Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely
        The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
        The insolence of office, and the spurns
        That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
        When he himself might his quietus make
        With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
        To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
        But that the dread of something after death,
        The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
        No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
        And makes us rather bear those ills we have
        Than fly to others that we know not of?
        Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
        And thus the native hue of resolution
        Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
        And enterprise of great pitch and moment
        With this regard their currents turn awry
        And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now,
        The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons
        Be all my sins remembered.</p>

        <p> The following is the beginning of an explanation found on <a href="http://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/quotes/hamlet-to-be-or-not-to-be/" target="_blank">nosweatshakespeare.com</a>.</p>

        <p> The first six words establish a balance. There is a direct opposition – to be, or not to be. Hamlet is thinking about life and death and pondering a state of being versus a state of not being – being alive and being dead.</p>

        <p>The balance continues with a consideration of the way one deals with life and death. Life is a lack of power: the living are at the mercy of the blows of outrageous fortune. The only action one can take against the things he lists among those blows is to end one’s life. That’s the only way of opposing them. Death is therefore empowering: killing oneself is a way of taking action, taking up arms, opposing and defeating the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Living is a passive state; dying is an active state. But in order to reach the condition of death one has to take action in life – charge fully armed against Fortune – so the whole proposition is circular and hopeless because one does not really have the power of action in life.</p>

        <p>Death is something desirable – devoutly  to be wished, a consummation – a perfect closure. It’s nothing more than a sleep. But there’s a catch, which Hamlet calls a rub. A ‘rub’ is a bowls term meaning an obstacle on the bowls lawn that diverts the bowl, so the fear of the life hereafter is the obstacle that makes us pause and perhaps change the direction of our thinking. We don’t control our dreams so what dreams may come in that sleep in which we have shuffled off all the fuss and bother of life? He uses the word ‘coil,’ which is an Elizabethan word for a big fuss, such as there may be in the preparations for a party or a wedding – a lot of things going on and a lot of rushing about. With that thought Hamlet stops to reconsider. What will happen when we have discarded all the hustle and bustle of life? The problem with the proposition is that life after death is unknown and could be worse than life. It’s a very frightening thought. That’s the obstacle on the lawn and it diverts his thoughts to another direction.</p>
